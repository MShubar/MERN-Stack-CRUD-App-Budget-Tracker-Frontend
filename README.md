### Budget Tracker Application
## Introduction
The Budget Tracker is a platform that allows users to keep track of tedious finances by creating budgets files where they can store their transactions in detail within categories. Users have the ability to view, create, update, delete transactions and categories. Users can later view summaries of some of their expenses on their dashboard, view upcoming/recurring transactions on their calendars and receive notifications!
